🚦 Traffic Department Management System

Hey everyone!

I'm working on a graduation project called Traffic Department Management System. It's a Flutter-based application designed to serve citizens, employees, and the head of the traffic department.

✨ The main goal is to make traffic services (licenses, vehicle registration, fines, etc.) accessible online instead of visiting the department physically.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Flutter (Frontend)

Node.js / Spring Boot / Django (Backend, not decided yet)

MySQL Database

✅ Features coming soon:

Citizen dashboard

Employee dashboard

Admin control panel

Online payments

Notifications system
